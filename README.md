# Random Forest

Random Forest is a classifier that contains a number of decision trees on various subsets of the given dataset and takes the average to improve the predictive accuracy of that dataset.

It is based on the concept of ensemble learning, which is a process of combining multiple classifiers to solve a complex problem and to improve the performance of the model.

The greater number of trees in the forest leads to higher accuracy and prevents the problem of overfitting.

In this notebook I have implemented Random Forest Classifier by working on two sklearn.datasets - make_classification and make_circles.

Thank you!
